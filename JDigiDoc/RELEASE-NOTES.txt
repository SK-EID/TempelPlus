DigiDoc Java library 3.8.1 release notes--------------------------------------Changes compared to ver 3.8- Added support for adding a data file to BDOC container from an in-memory byte array. Method DataFile.setBody(byte[] data) can be used for that purpose. - Added command -ddoc-add-mem to jdigidoc.java utility program. The command enables adding data file to DDOC or BDOC container from an in-memory byte array via method DataFile.setBody(byte[] data).- Changed DataFile.setBody(byte[] data) method in case of adding data file content to DDOC files - the input data is now always converted to base64 encoding. In case the data file is already in base64 format then method DataFile.setBodyAsData(byte[] data, boolean b64, long len) should be used instead to avoid double base64 encoding of the data.- Added method DataFile.setBodyAsData(byte[] data, boolean b64, long len) which enables adding data file contents to DDOC container from an in-memory byte array. If the boolean parameter b64 is set to true then the original data is not converted to base64.- Fixed DDOC data file hash calculation problem which occurred when using method DataFile.setBase64Body(byte[]).- Improved cache file handling, added possibility to avoid creation of any temporary cache files by setting the jdigidoc.cfg configuration file parameter DIGIDOC_MAX_DATAFILE_CACHED value to a negative integer.- Fixed BDOC signature's Reference element validation problem which occurred when the container was verified before writing it to an output file or stream.- Fixed BDOC container's mimetype file compression, the file's contents are not compressed.- Fixed unhandled error situation which occurred when adding an OCSP confirmation but the OCSP responder CA certificate was not in trusted certificates' list.- Improved slot handling when signing via PKCS11 module, tokens are only searched from slots where a token is present.- DigiDocService related functionality in JDigiDoc is not fully supported and has been deprecated. Added @deprecated annotations to DigiDocServiceFactory class and its methods, removed -mid-sign and -dss-server-test1 commands from jdigidoc.java utility program and M-ID related entries from configuration file.DDOC/BDOC/CDOC security fixes:- Removed support for DTD entity declarations in DDOC, BDOC and CDOC files XML content. This is a security fix screening the parsing of DigiDoc files from "XML Entity Expansion" type attacks. There is a potential that an arbitrary (hostile) content might be crafted into DigiDoc files and as the result, a server using unpatched JDigiDoc library could be engineered into trouble, e.g. to use excessive memory resources. The developers have to be aware of following factors: a) JDigiDoc could be used on many different systemsb) Other similar (and unpatched) libraries are in use elsewhere in context of the "XML Entity Expansion" feature.c) There was no software bug in JDigiDoc but an adaption to too wide standards.d) The extent of trouble with any affected server heavily depends on the overall security level of the operating environment, and not so much on the particular content within any DigiDoc file.Known issues:- BDOC file's validation process does not discover error situation if there is a correctly signed data file in the container but manifest.xml does not contain an entry for that data file.- BDOC file's validation process does not discover error situation if the mimetype file is empty.DigiDoc Java library 3.8 release notes--------------------------------------Changes compared to ver 3.7.2- Improved the validation of signer's certificate path, added check if all of the chain's certificates validity period includes the signature creation time (producedAt field's value in OCSP response). - Fixed validation of DDOC files that are created in hashcode mode(used in DigiDocService).- Added API method DigiDocGenFactory.isTestCard(X509Certificate) for identifying if a certificate is SK issued test certificate. The identification is done with comparing certificate policy OID values.- Changed DigiDoc file's validation process if a fatal error is discovered. The validation process is terminated and exception is returned when it is not possible to parse the input file's XML structure.- Changed signer role and resolution data handling inside DigiDoc document. Only one <ClaimedRole> element is created for DDOC and BDOC documents during signing. The element can contain only the signer's role or role and resolution combined in a single string in the form of "role / resolution".- Added new API method Signature.verify(SignedDoc, ArrayList) to enable better validation of one signature object separately. The method can be used to distinguish the single signature's validation errors from the rest of the DigiDoc document. - Added warnings system. In case of minor technical errors in the signed DigiDoc file, validation result VALID WITH WARNINGS is used, meaning that the file is legally valid but further alterations (adding/removing signatures) are restricted. It is recommended to implement using validation status VALID WITH WARNINGS as described in documentation. The warnings system is implemented in jdigidoc.java utility program (identically to DigiDoc3 Client desktop applicaton), warning situations include:	- DDOC file's <DataFile> element's xmlns attribute is missing (error code 173) 	- The DigiDoc file format is older than officially accepted, i.e. the file is DDOC 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 or BDOC 1.0 (error code 177).	- DDOC file's <X509IssuerName> or <X509SerialNumber> element's xmlns attribute is missing (error code 176).	- Weaker digest method has been used in BDOC file than officially accepted (error code 129).	- The signature has been created with a test certificate (error code 178).- Changed the priorities of DigiDoc file's validation result statuses. - Added error codes 172 (ERR_DF_NAME), 173 (ERR_DF_INV_HASH_GOOD_ALT_HASH), 174 (ERR_SIGVAL_00), 175 (ERR_TRANSFORMS), 176 (ERR_ISSUER_XMLNS), 177 (ERR_OLD_VER), 178 (ERR_TEST_SIGNATURE)- Changed the printed output of jdigidoc.java utility program's -ddoc-validate command, fixed the problem of printing out registry code value in case of corporate certificates.- Removed -ddoc-list command from jdigidoc.java utility program. -ddoc-validate provides the same functionality and should be used instead.- Changed the default directory where temporary files are stored in case of handling big input files. By default, the java.io.tmpdir value is now used. The parameter DIGIDOC_DF_CACHE_DIR must be specified in jdigidoc.cfg file in order to change the default directory value.- Added error code 172, returned when parsing the signed file when there are unallowed symbols '/' and '\' in datafile name.- Fixed problem with missing xmlns attribute in elements <X509IssuerName> and <X509SerialNumber> when creating signatures in case of DDOC 1.3 files. Added DDOC file's error handling in case of missing xmlns attribute in these elements.- Added additional check for file name in SaxDigiDocFactory class, method readSignedDocOfType(String, InputStream, boolean, ArrayList).- Fixed DIGIDOC_OCSP_RESPONDER_URL handling as default ocsp responder url in jdigidoc.cfg config file- Removed DIGIDOC_DEFAULT_DIGEST BDOC configuration parameter from jdigidoc.cfg configuration file, kept configuration parameter DIGIDOC_DIGEST_TYPE which now specifies default digest type for all hashes.- Removed configuration file parameter CHECK_SIGNATURE_VALUE_ASN1. Signature values with erroneous ASN.1 prefix values are regarded as not valid.- Added support for new KLASS3-SK 2010 CA certificate.- Added KLASS3-SK 2010 OCSP RESPONDER, EID-SK and ESTEID-SK 2007 certificate entries to jdigidoc.cfg configuration file.- Removed duplicate entries for TEST of ESTEID-SK 2011 OCSP responder in jdigidoc.cfg configuration file.- Fixed releasing output stream after file parsing in setOrCacheBodyAndCalcHashes function in Datafile class- Fixed DDOC DataFile attribute DigestType in xmlHeader method value SHA-1 (was sha1)- Fixed DDOC byte-order-mark (BOM) symbol handling     - Added support for DDOC with DataFile id=DO.- Changed checking for DDOC document's <DataFile> element's Id attribute value when validating the file's XML structure. By default, it is checked that the value is in the form D<number> or DO, other values are not allowed.- Removed BDOC 1.0 support.- Added support for BDOC 2.1 file format - Added error handling for BDOC files that include <Transforms> element. The element is not supported in DigiDoc libraries.- Fixed BDOC Mimetype handling. Added error handling if the Mimetype file is missing from the container. Mimetype file must be the first file in BDOC zip container.- Added BDOC Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based certificates support. Added ListAlgorithms.java utility for EC algorithm code availability checking. For ECC added BouncyCastle crypto lib version 1.48- Added BDOC error handling for duplicate signatures*.xml file names- Added BDOC error handling for two signatures in one signatures*.xml file (error code 75 is returned).- Added BDOC, DDOC error handling for duplicate DataFile name. Duplicate datafile by name in container results in error.- Fixed BDOC error handling for datafile reference. Unsigned datafile in signed container results in error.- Fixed BDOC and DDOC multiple ocsp responses error handling. - Fixed checking of OCSP nonce field's ASN.1 prefix value in case of BDOC files when creating signatures. DDOC/BDOC/CDOC security fixes:- Fixed DDOC DataFile/Reference error checking. This is a highly relevant security fix having an effect on the verification of DDOC files. The unfixed library can mistakenly give positive results on validation of invalid DDOC container contained a data file that was not referenced by any signature- Fixed DDOC DataFile element DigestValue attribute verification. This is a highly relevant security fix having an effect on the verification of DDOC files. The unfixed library can mistakenly give positive results on validation of invalid DDOC container with modified DataFile element contents.Known issues:- BDOC file's validation process does not discover error situation if there is a correctly signed data file in the container but manifest.xml does not contain an entry for that data file.- BDOC file's validation process does not discover error situation if the mimetype file is empty.- Known issues about adding data file to a container from a byte array: 	- In case of DDOC files, method DataFile.setBase64Body(byte[]) does not function properly, the digest of the data file is not calculated correctly. Method DataFile.setBody(byte[]) should be used instead. 	- In case of DDOC files, method DataFile.setBody(byte[]) does not function properly if temporary cache files are used for storing data file contents during signature creation.  The error can be avoided when commenting out jdigidoc.cfg configuration file parameter DIGIDOC_MAX_DATAFILE_CACHED, so that temporary cache files are not created.	- In case of BDOC files, adding data file to a container from a byte array is not supported, the data must be added from a file in the file system with method SignedDoc.addDataFile(File, String, String). DigiDoc Java library 3.7.2 release notes--------------------------------------Changes compared to ver 3.7.1- Removed BDOC 1.0 support - DDOC/CDOC security fixes:- Fixed the opening of DDOC container with a faulty DataFile name tag. This is a highly relevant security fix having an effect on the verification of DDOC files. The unfixed library can result in overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the privileges of the victim.
