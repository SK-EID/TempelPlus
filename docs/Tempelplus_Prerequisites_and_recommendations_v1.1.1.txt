Requirements and recommendations:

* Already installed on the computer:
  *Java JDK/JRE ver 1.6 or higher
  * Aladdin eToken software, you receive the Aladdin eToken 
software when you order from SK your digital stamp on the 
Aladdin eToken USB stick.
* If you have already been using previous versions of TempelPlus 
(v 0.99 or 1.0.0), you can create a backup of the configuration file 
(Tempelplus.conf). NB!  A new version of the software has more 
configuration parameters than previous versions. Configuration files 
from previous versions are not suitable for use in one-to-one in the 
new version.
* Since the new version contains many enhancements and also the 
installation has changed (formerly there was .msi package, now zip / 
tar.gz container), you are advised to read the new version changelog 
(Chapter 2.1), software installation (Chapter 3 ) and configuration 
(Chapter 6) of the software documentation, which is located in the 
installation package  docs subdirectory. Chapter 7 describes, how to 
use TempelPlus with test-digital stamp.
