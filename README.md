# TempelPlus - digital stamping software

The TempelPlus software is designed for signing of large quantities of files (mass signing) with the institution’s digital stamp, for instance: invoices, payment orders, certificates, etc.

The TempelPlus software is a useful assistant when there are many files to be signed and a separate signed container (.bdoc) must be created for each signed file.
